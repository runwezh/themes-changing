# Brownfield Service Enhancement Workflow

## Overview
Workflow for adding new services or enhancing existing services in an established system, with focus on integration and minimal disruption.

## Prerequisites
- [ ] Existing system architecture understood
- [ ] Service requirements defined
- [ ] Impact analysis completed
- [ ] Stakeholder approval obtained

## Phase 1: Analysis & Planning

### Step 1: System Assessment
- [ ] Analyze existing architecture
- [ ] Identify integration points
- [ ] Review current technology stack
- [ ] Assess performance implications
- [ ] Document dependencies

### Step 2: Service Design
```
Execute: *create-doc architecture-tmpl
```
Focus on:
- Service boundaries and responsibilities
- API design and contracts
- Data model and storage requirements
- Integration patterns
- Security considerations

### Step 3: Impact Analysis
- [ ] Identify affected components
- [ ] Assess backward compatibility
- [ ] Plan migration strategies
- [ ] Evaluate performance impact
- [ ] Document risk factors

## Phase 2: Development Planning

### Step 4: Create User Stories
```
Execute: *task create-next-story
```
For each service feature:
- Define user value
- Specify acceptance criteria
- Estimate complexity
- Identify dependencies

### Step 5: Technical Planning
- [ ] Design service interfaces
- [ ] Plan database changes
- [ ] Design integration approach
- [ ] Plan testing strategy
- [ ] Schedule development phases

## Phase 3: Implementation

### Step 6: Service Development
- [ ] Implement core service logic
- [ ] Create API endpoints
- [ ] Implement data access layer
- [ ] Add authentication/authorization
- [ ] Implement error handling

### Step 7: Integration Development
- [ ] Implement service clients
- [ ] Update existing services
- [ ] Modify shared components
- [ ] Update configuration
- [ ] Implement monitoring

### Step 8: Database Changes
- [ ] Create migration scripts
- [ ] Update data models
- [ ] Implement data validation
- [ ] Plan rollback procedures
- [ ] Test migration process

## Phase 4: Testing & Validation

### Step 9: Service Testing
- [ ] Unit test service logic
- [ ] Test API endpoints
- [ ] Validate data operations
- [ ] Test error scenarios
- [ ] Performance testing

### Step 10: Integration Testing
- [ ] Test service integrations
- [ ] Validate end-to-end flows
- [ ] Test backward compatibility
- [ ] Verify data consistency
- [ ] Load testing

### Step 11: System Testing
- [ ] Full system regression testing
- [ ] Performance impact assessment
- [ ] Security testing
- [ ] User acceptance testing
- [ ] Monitoring validation

## Phase 5: Deployment Strategy

### Step 12: Deployment Planning
- [ ] Plan deployment sequence
- [ ] Prepare rollback procedures
- [ ] Configure feature flags
- [ ] Plan monitoring strategy
- [ ] Coordinate with operations

### Step 13: Staged Deployment
- [ ] Deploy to development environment
- [ ] Deploy to staging environment
- [ ] Conduct pre-production testing
- [ ] Deploy to production (phased)
- [ ] Monitor and validate

## Phase 6: Post-Deployment

### Step 14: Monitoring & Validation
- [ ] Monitor service performance
- [ ] Validate business metrics
- [ ] Check error rates
- [ ] Verify integration health
- [ ] Gather user feedback

### Step 15: Documentation & Handover
```
Execute: *task document-project
```
- Update system documentation
- Document new service APIs
- Update deployment procedures
- Create troubleshooting guides
- Train support team

## Quality Checkpoints

### Design Review
```
Execute: *execute-checklist architect-checklist
```
Focus on integration and compatibility.

### Code Review
- [ ] Service implementation reviewed
- [ ] Integration code reviewed
- [ ] Database changes reviewed
- [ ] Security implications reviewed
- [ ] Performance impact reviewed

### Deployment Readiness
```
Execute: *execute-checklist change-checklist
```
Ensure minimal disruption to existing services.

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained
- [ ] Performance degradation prevented
- [ ] Data integrity protected
- [ ] Service availability maintained
- [ ] Rollback procedures tested

### Operational Risks
- [ ] Deployment procedures validated
- [ ] Monitoring coverage adequate
- [ ] Support procedures updated
- [ ] Team training completed
- [ ] Communication plan executed

## Success Criteria
